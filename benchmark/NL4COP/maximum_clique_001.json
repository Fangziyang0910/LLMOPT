  "problem_description": "A social network analyst is conducting an in-depth study on interpersonal relationship dynamics within a diverse community of 10 individuals who regularly interact through various social activities and gatherings. The complex friendship network reveals that person 0 has established meaningful connections with persons 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 through shared interests and frequent interactions. Person 1's social circle includes persons 2, 3, 4, and 6, with whom they maintain regular communication and mutual support. Person 2 has developed strong bonds with persons 3, 5, 6, and 7 through collaborative projects and recreational activities. Person 3's interpersonal network extends to persons 4, 6, and 7, characterized by trust and reciprocal relationships. Person 4 maintains close friendships with persons 5, 7, and 8, often participating in group events together. Person 5's social connections include persons 6, 7, and 9, forming a supportive community network. Person 6 enjoys companionship with persons 7 and 8, sharing common experiences and values. Person 7 has formed a significant friendship with person 9, marked by deep understanding and mutual respect. Finally, person 8 has established a meaningful connection with person 9 through shared activities and interests. The analyst aims to identify the most cohesive subgroup where complete mutual familiarity exists among all members, determining exactly which individuals form this tightly-knit social cluster and quantifying its size.",
