  "problem_description": "The International Academic Consortium is orchestrating a high-level symposium on interdisciplinary research methodologies, where ten distinct scholarly domains are being considered for inclusion in a prestigious plenary session. The consortium's editorial board has conducted a comprehensive compatibility analysis revealing complex epistemological tensions between certain research paradigms that would create intellectual dissonance if presented concurrently. The intricate interparadigmatic relationships reveal that research paradigm 0 exhibits theoretical incompatibilities with paradigms 1, 2, and 6 due to fundamental ontological disagreements. Research paradigm 1 demonstrates methodological conflicts with paradigms 0, 2, and 9 stemming from divergent epistemological foundations. Research paradigm 2 shares conceptual tensions with paradigms 0 and 1 arising from incompatible axiomatic assumptions. Research paradigm 3 experiences paradigmatic friction with paradigms 4 and 5 reflecting conflicting philosophical orientations. Research paradigm 4 encounters intellectual discord with paradigms 3, 5, and 9 based on irreconcilable theoretical frameworks. Research paradigm 5 faces conceptual opposition with paradigms 3 and 4 due to competing methodological approaches. Research paradigm 6 exhibits scholarly incompatibilities with paradigms 0 and 7 reflecting divergent research traditions. Research paradigm 7 demonstrates academic tensions with paradigms 6 and 9 stemming from contrasting disciplinary perspectives. Research paradigm 8 maintains theoretical neutrality and harmonious compatibility with all other research paradigms. Research paradigm 9 experiences intellectual conflicts with paradigms 1, 4, and 7 due to fundamental paradigmatic differences. The consortium's steering committee must determine the optimal configuration of research paradigms that can be simultaneously featured in the plenary session while maintaining complete intellectual coherence and avoiding any epistemological dissonance between selected paradigms.",
